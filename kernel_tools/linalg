def cusolver_eigh(a, il, iu):
    """
    Get the index range of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. 
    This function destroys the tensor passed in. The eigenvectors
    are placed inside the passed in tensor in sorted order. It is 
    still best to clone this view as having an active view on this potentially
    large tensor keeps the entire tensor from being freed.
    
    Parameters:
    a (torch::Tensor): The matrix
    il (int): The lower index of eigenvalues and vectors to retrieve.
    iu (int): The upper index of eigenvalues and vectors to retrieve.
    
    Returns:
    eigenvalues, eigenvectors of the range specified
